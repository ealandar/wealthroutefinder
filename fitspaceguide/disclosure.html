  <!-- Content -->
  <div class="content-wrap">
    <h2>FTC Disclosure</h2>
    <p>In accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines, Fit Space Guide would like to disclose that some of the links on this website are affiliate links. This means that if you click on the link and purchase an item, we may receive an affiliate commission at no extra cost to you.</p>

    <h2>Amazon Associates Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Fit Space Guide is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for website owners to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com, and any other website that may be affiliated with Amazon Service LLC Associates Program.</p>

    <div class="affiliate-note">
      <strong>Amazon Affiliate ID:</strong> As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases. Our Amazon affiliate tag is <strong>ivanykallc-20</strong>. Clicking our links and making a purchase supports our site at no additional cost to you.
    </div>

    <h2>How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
    <p>When you click on an affiliate link on our website and make a purchase, the retailer recognizes that you were referred by us. If you complete a qualifying purchase, we receive a small percentage of the sale as a commission. The price you pay remains the same whether you use our affiliate link or go directly to the retailer's website.</p>

    <h2>Our Commitment to Honesty</h2>
    <p>We want to emphasize the following principles that guide our content:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Editorial Independence:</strong> Our affiliate relationships do not influence our product reviews, ratings, or recommendations. We recommend products based on their quality, value, and suitability for home fitness use.</li>
      <li><strong>Honest Reviews:</strong> We provide balanced reviews that include both advantages and disadvantages of every product. If a product has significant drawbacks, we will tell you.</li>
      <li><strong>No Pay-for-Play:</strong> Companies cannot pay us to write favorable reviews. Our opinions are our own and are based on research and analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Best Interest:</strong> Our primary goal is to help you make informed purchasing decisions. We would rather lose a commission by being honest than earn one by misleading our readers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to Amazon Associates, we may participate in other affiliate programs in the future. Any additional affiliate relationships will be disclosed on this page. All affiliate partnerships are subject to the same editorial integrity standards described above.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Thorough research of product specifications and features</li>
      <li>Analysis of verified customer reviews and feedback</li>
      <li>Comparison with competing products in the same category</li>
      <li>Assessment of overall value for the price</li>
      <li>Consideration of space requirements and practicality for home use</li>
    </ul>
