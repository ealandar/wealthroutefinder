    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Fit Space Guide was founded with a simple goal: to help everyday people create effective, space-efficient home gyms without wasting money on equipment that does not deliver. We believe that everyone deserves access to reliable, unbiased information when investing in their health and fitness.</p>

    <p>Whether you are setting up your first workout corner in a small apartment or building a fully equipped garage gym, our reviews and guides are designed to help you make smart choices that match your space, budget, and fitness goals.</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>We research, compare, and review home fitness equipment across every major category:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strength Training:</strong> Dumbbells, kettlebells, barbells, resistance bands, and weight benches</li>
      <li><strong>Cardio Equipment:</strong> Treadmills, exercise bikes, rowing machines, and ellipticals</li>
      <li><strong>Recovery &amp; Flexibility:</strong> Yoga mats, foam rollers, massage guns, and stretching aids</li>
      <li><strong>Accessories:</strong> Gym flooring, storage solutions, mirrors, and organizational gear</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Review Process</h2>
    <p>Every piece of content on Fit Space Guide goes through a thorough process:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Research:</strong> We analyze manufacturer specifications, materials, and construction quality for each product.</li>
      <li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> We aggregate and analyze hundreds of verified buyer reviews to identify real-world performance patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Products are compared against direct competitors in the same category and price range.</li>
      <li><strong>Honest Assessment:</strong> We highlight both pros and cons because no product is perfect, and your needs are unique.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Honesty First:</strong> We will never recommend a product we would not use ourselves. If something falls short, we say so.</li>
      <li><strong>Space Awareness:</strong> Not everyone has a dedicated gym room. We prioritize equipment that works in real living spaces.</li>
      <li><strong>Budget Respect:</strong> Great fitness does not require expensive equipment. We cover options at every price point.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We clearly disclose our affiliate relationships. Read our <a href="disclosure.html">affiliate disclosure</a> for full details.</li>
    </ul>
