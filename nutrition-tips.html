            <h2>Tip 1: Know Your Caloric Needs</h2>
            <p>Before adjusting your diet, understand how many calories your body needs. Your goals determine your approach:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lose fat</strong> — Eat 300-500 calories below your maintenance level</li>
                <li><strong>Build muscle</strong> — Eat 200-500 calories above your maintenance level</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain</strong> — Eat at your maintenance level</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Use an online TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) calculator as a starting point, then adjust based on your actual results over two to four weeks.</p>

            <h2>Tip 2: Prioritize Protein at Every Meal</h2>
            <p>Protein is the building block of muscle. If you are training regularly, aim for 0.7-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day. Spread your protein intake across three to five meals for optimal muscle protein synthesis.</p>
            <p>Great protein sources include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken breast, turkey, and lean beef</li>
                <li>Fish and seafood (salmon, tuna, shrimp)</li>
                <li>Eggs and egg whites</li>
                <li>Greek yogurt and cottage cheese</li>
                <li>Legumes, tofu, and tempeh for plant-based options</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tip 3: Do Not Fear Carbohydrates</h2>
            <p>Carbs are your body's primary fuel source for intense training. Cutting carbs too aggressively will tank your workout performance, mood, and recovery.</p>
            <p>Focus on complex carbohydrates: oats, rice, potatoes, sweet potatoes, whole grain bread, fruits, and vegetables. Time your largest carb intake around your training sessions for maximum energy and recovery.</p>

            <h2>Tip 4: Eat Enough Healthy Fats</h2>
            <p>Dietary fat supports hormone production (including testosterone), brain function, and joint health. Aim for 0.3-0.5 grams of fat per pound of body weight daily.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prioritize</strong> — Avocados, olive oil, nuts, seeds, fatty fish</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate</strong> — Cheese, whole eggs, dark chocolate</li>
                <li><strong>Limit</strong> — Fried foods, highly processed snacks, trans fats</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tip 5: Hydrate Consistently</h2>
            <p>Even mild dehydration (1-2% body weight loss in water) reduces strength, endurance, and cognitive function. Drink at least half your body weight (in lbs) in ounces of water daily. Add more if you train hard or live in a hot climate.</p>
            <p>Signs of inadequate hydration: dark urine, headaches, fatigue, and decreased workout performance.</p>

            <h2>Tip 6: Meal Prep for Consistency</h2>
            <p>The number one reason people eat poorly is lack of preparation. When you are hungry and have no healthy food ready, fast food wins every time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pick one day per week to cook in bulk (Sunday works for most people)</li>
                <li>Prepare 4-5 days of protein, carbs, and vegetables in containers</li>
                <li>Keep healthy snacks accessible: nuts, fruit, protein bars, hard-boiled eggs</li>
                <li>Pre-portion meals so you do not have to think about macros during the week</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Recommended reading:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1628601264?tag=ivanykallc-20">Meal Prep for Weight Loss</a> provides practical recipes and meal prep strategies for staying on track with your nutrition goals.</p>

            <h2>Tip 7: Time Your Pre- and Post-Workout Meals</h2>
            <p><strong>Pre-workout (1-2 hours before):</strong> A balanced meal with protein and carbs gives you energy and prevents muscle breakdown during training. Example: chicken with rice, or oatmeal with protein powder.</p>
            <p><strong>Post-workout (within 2 hours after):</strong> A meal with protein and carbs supports muscle repair and glycogen replenishment. Example: a protein shake with a banana, or fish with sweet potato.</p>

            <h2>Tip 8: Limit Processed Foods (But Do Not Eliminate Them)</h2>
            <p>The 80/20 rule works well: eat whole, minimally processed foods 80% of the time, and allow yourself flexibility with the remaining 20%. Complete restriction leads to binge eating and an unhealthy relationship with food.</p>

            <h2>Tip 9: Use Supplements Wisely</h2>
            <p>Supplements are meant to supplement a solid diet, not replace one. The only supplements with strong scientific backing for most lifters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creatine monohydrate</strong> — 5g daily, the most researched and effective sports supplement for strength and muscle growth</li>
                <li><strong>Protein powder</strong> — Convenient way to hit your daily protein target when whole foods fall short</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin D</strong> — Especially if you live in a northern climate or spend most of your time indoors</li>
                <li><strong>Fish oil (omega-3s)</strong> — Supports joint health and reduces inflammation</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Recommended:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NNH3QGC?tag=ivanykallc-20">Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey Protein</a> is a well-tested, high-quality protein powder trusted by millions of athletes worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Tip 10: Track Your Intake for at Least 30 Days</h2>
            <p>You do not need to track calories forever, but doing it for 30 days teaches you what proper portions look like and where your macros actually fall. Most people drastically underestimate calories consumed and overestimate protein intake.</p>
            <p>Use a free app or a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BT56Z9MG?tag=ivanykallc-20">food and fitness journal</a> to log meals for one month. The awareness alone can transform your eating habits.</p>
