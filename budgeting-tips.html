    </section>

    <section class="content">
        <article>
            <h2>Tip 1: Know Your "Why"</h2>
            <p>A budget without a purpose is a budget you will abandon. Maybe you want to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pay off $15,000 in student loans within two years</li>
                <li>Save for a down payment on a home</li>
                <li>Build a six-month emergency fund</li>
                <li>Take a dream vacation without going into debt</li>
                <li>Retire ten years earlier than expected</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tip 2: Start With the 50/30/20 Rule</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>50% of after-tax income for needs</strong> — rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, transportation</li>
                <li><strong>30% for wants</strong> — dining out, entertainment, hobbies, subscriptions</li>
                <li><strong>20% for savings and extra debt payments</strong> — emergency fund, retirement, extra payments on loans</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tip 3: Track Your Spending for 30 Days</h2>
            <p><strong>Recommended tool:</strong> The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S4HP2QN?tag=ivanykallc-20">Clever Fox Budget Planner</a> is designed specifically for monthly expense tracking.</p>
            <p>Most people discover at least $200 to $500 in monthly spending they did not realize was happening.</p>

            <h2>Tip 4: Automate Everything You Can</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bill payments</strong> — Set up autopay for every recurring bill</li>
                <li><strong>Savings transfers</strong> — Schedule automatic transfers to your savings account on payday</li>
                <li><strong>Investment contributions</strong> — Automate 401(k) and IRA contributions</li>
                <li><strong>Debt payments</strong> — Set up automatic extra payments above the minimum</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tip 5: Use the Envelope System for Problem Categories</h2>
            <p>The physical act of handing over cash creates a psychological "pain of paying." Studies show that people spend 12% to 18% less when using cash versus cards.</p>

            <h2>Tip 6: Cut Subscriptions Ruthlessly</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Review your bank and credit card statements for all recurring charges</li>
                <li>List every subscription with its monthly cost</li>
                <li>For each one, ask: "Did I use this in the last 30 days?"</li>
                <li>Cancel everything that does not pass the test</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Cutting three unused subscriptions at $15 each saves $540 per year.</p>

            <h2>Tip 7: Implement a 24-Hour Rule for Non-Essential Purchases</h2>
            <p>Before buying anything non-essential over $50, wait 24 hours. For larger purchases over $200, extend to one week.</p>

            <h2>Tip 8: Plan Your Meals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduces grocery waste</strong> — You buy only what you need</li>
                <li><strong>Eliminates last-minute takeout</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Enables bulk buying</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Recommended reading:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0312607334?tag=ivanykallc-20">The $5 Dinner Mom Cookbook</a> by Erin Chase proves that delicious, healthy meals do not have to be expensive.</p>

            <h2>Tip 9: Build Buffer Money Into Your Budget</h2>
            <p>Create a "miscellaneous" category with $100 to $200 per month as buffer money.</p>

            <h2>Tip 10: Review and Adjust Monthly</h2>
            <p>Schedule a 15-minute monthly budget review:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Compare actual spending to planned spending</li>
                <li>Identify categories where you consistently overspend or underspend</li>
                <li>Adjust allocations for the next month</li>
                <li>Celebrate your progress</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Recommended Books on Budgeting and Money Management</h2>
