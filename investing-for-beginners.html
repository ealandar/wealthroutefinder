            <h2>Why You Need to Invest</h2>
            <p>Saving money is essential, but savings alone will not build wealth. Here is why:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A high-yield savings account pays roughly 4-5% APY</li>
                <li>The stock market has historically returned approximately 10% per year on average</li>
                <li>Inflation erodes the purchasing power of cash at roughly 2-3% per year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you keep $10,000 in a savings account for 30 years at 4% APY, you will have about $32,400. If you invest that same $10,000 averaging 10% annual returns, you will have approximately $174,500.</p>

            <h2>Key Investing Concepts</h2>

            <h3>Compound Interest</h3>
            <p>Compound interest means you earn returns not just on your original investment, but also on the returns you have already earned.</p>

            <h3>Risk and Return</h3>
            <p>Higher potential returns come with higher risk. As a beginner, your goal is to balance risk and return through diversification.</p>

            <h3>Diversification</h3>
            <p>Diversification means spreading your money across many different investments.</p>

            <h2>Types of Investments</h2>

            <h3>Stocks</h3>
            <p>When you buy a stock, you own a small piece of a company. Highest long-term growth potential but also highest short-term volatility.</p>

            <h3>Bonds</h3>
            <p>Bonds are loans you make to governments or corporations in exchange for regular interest payments. Generally safer than stocks but lower returns.</p>

            <h3>Index Funds</h3>
            <p>An index fund is a collection of stocks or bonds designed to match the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&amp;P 500.</p>

            <h3>ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)</h3>
            <p>ETFs are similar to index funds but trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks. Many ETFs have expense ratios as low as 0.03%.</p>

            <h3>Mutual Funds</h3>
            <p>Mutual funds pool money from many investors. Passive index mutual funds typically outperform actively managed ones over time due to lower fees.</p>

            <h2>Where to Invest: Account Types</h2>

            <h3>401(k)</h3>
            <p>If your employer offers a 401(k) with a company match, this should be your first investment priority.</p>

            <h3>Roth IRA</h3>
            <p>Funded with after-tax dollars, but all future growth and withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free. For 2025, you can contribute up to $7,000 per year.</p>

            <h3>Traditional IRA</h3>
            <p>Contributions may be tax-deductible. Investments grow tax-deferred.</p>

            <h3>Taxable Brokerage Account</h3>
            <p>For investing beyond retirement accounts. No contribution limits or withdrawal restrictions.</p>

            <h2>How to Start Investing: A Simple Plan</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Get Your Financial Foundation Ready</h3>
            <p>Before investing, make sure you have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An emergency fund covering three to six months of expenses</li>
                <li>All high-interest debt (above 7-8%) paid off</li>
                <li>A monthly budget with room for consistent contributions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Open the Right Account</h3>
            <p>If you have an employer 401(k) with a match, start there. Next, open a Roth IRA with a low-cost brokerage.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Choose a Simple Portfolio</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>80-90% in a total stock market index fund</strong></li>
                <li><strong>10-20% in a total bond market index fund</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Automate Your Contributions</h3>
            <p>Set up automatic monthly contributions. This is called dollar-cost averaging.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Leave It Alone</h3>
            <p>The stock market drops 10% or more roughly once per year on average. These dips are normal and temporary.</p>

            <h2>Recommended Books for Beginner Investors</h2>

                <li><strong>Ignoring tax-advantaged accounts</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Checking your portfolio daily</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Start investing as early as possible to maximize compound growth</li>

                <li>Keep fees low and ignore short-term noise</li>
            </ul>
