                <h2>What Is an Emergency Fund?</h2>
                <p>An emergency fund is a dedicated pool of cash set aside exclusively for true emergencies — unexpected, urgent expenses that you cannot plan for.</p>
                <p>True emergencies include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Job loss or sudden income reduction</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Medical or dental emergencies</strong> not fully covered by insurance</li>
                    <li><strong>Major car repairs</strong> necessary for getting to work</li>
                    <li><strong>Critical home repairs</strong> like a broken water heater or roof leak</li>
                    <li><strong>Unexpected travel</strong> for a family emergency</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How Much Do You Actually Need?</h2>
                <p>The standard advice is to save three to six months of essential living expenses.</p>

                <h3>Calculate Your Monthly Essentials</h3>
                <p>Add up only your non-negotiable monthly expenses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rent or mortgage payment</li>
                    <li>Utilities (electricity, water, gas, internet)</li>
                    <li>Groceries (not dining out)</li>
                    <li>Transportation (car payment, gas, insurance, or transit pass)</li>
                    <li>Insurance premiums (health, auto, renters)</li>
                    <li>Minimum debt payments</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Choose Your Target</h3>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Your Situation</th>
                            <th>Recommended Fund Size</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Dual income, stable jobs, no dependents</td>
                            <td>3 months of essentials</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Single income, stable job</td>
                            <td>4-5 months of essentials</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Self-employed or variable income</td>
                            <td>6-9 months of essentials</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Single parent or sole provider</td>
                            <td>6-12 months of essentials</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <h2>Where to Keep Your Emergency Fund</h2>
                <p>Your emergency fund needs to be:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Safe</strong> — No risk of losing principal</li>
                    <li><strong>Liquid</strong> — Accessible within one to two business days</li>
                    <li><strong>Separate</strong> — Not mixed with your everyday checking account</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The best place is a <strong>high-yield savings account</strong> at an FDIC-insured online bank.</p>
                <p>Avoid putting your emergency fund in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stocks or mutual funds</strong> — Market drops could reduce your fund right when you need it</li>
                    <li><strong>Certificates of deposit (CDs)</strong> — Early withdrawal penalties reduce flexibility</li>
                    <li><strong>Your checking account</strong> — Too easy to spend accidentally</li>
                    <li><strong>Cash at home</strong> — No interest, risk of theft or loss</li>
                </ul>
