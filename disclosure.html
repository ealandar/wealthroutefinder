            <h2>FTC Disclosure</h2>
            <p>In accordance with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines, we want to be fully transparent about how Wealth Route Finder earns revenue. Some of the links on this website are affiliate links, meaning we may earn a commission if you click on the link or make a purchase using the link, at no additional cost to you.</p>

            <h2>Amazon Associates Program</h2>
            <p><strong>Wealth Route Finder</strong> is a participant in the <strong>Amazon Services LLC Associates Program</strong>, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to <strong>Amazon.com</strong>.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases. This means that when you click on an Amazon link on our site and make a purchase, we may receive a small commission at no extra cost to you.</p>

            <h2>How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
            <p>When you click on an affiliate link on our website:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>A small tracking cookie is placed on your device</li>
                <li>If you make a purchase within the cookie's active window, we receive a small commission</li>
                <li><strong>You pay the same price</strong> whether you use our affiliate link or go directly to the site</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Commitment to Honesty</h2>
            <p>We value your trust, and we are committed to the following principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Honest Reviews</strong> — We only recommend products and services that we genuinely believe are valuable. Our opinions are our own and are not influenced by affiliate partnerships.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — Affiliate links are clearly disclosed. We will never hide the fact that we may earn a commission from your purchase.</li>
                <li><strong>Reader First</strong> — Our content is created to help you make informed financial decisions. Revenue from affiliate links helps us continue producing free, high-quality content.</li>
                <li><strong>No Pay-for-Placement</strong> — Companies cannot pay us to guarantee a favorable review or top placement in our recommendations.</li>
